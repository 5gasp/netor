# Nielsen's Heuristics
```
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

# Evaluator 1

1. ## Visibility of system status
    
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. There is an effort maintain the platform up-to-date in relation to the underlying system, present the status of the various entities and update the platform after each action. A feedback is also performed through a toast message if the action was successful.

2. ## Match between system and the real world
    
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. The names and acronyms used are those used in the industry and current 5G NFV community.
    
3. ## User control and freedom
    
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. When performing any relevant action, a menu appears to verify that it was truly intended, enabling to cancel if it was a mistake.

4. ## Consistency and standards
   
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. The closing buttons are in the expected locations. The buttons expected to work, such as escape, enter, backspace and others effectively work when expected.

5. ## Error prevention
   
    Severity: 1
    
    Problems: When a error occurs there is an effort to log and present the error message through, in this case, a toast message. Validation are also performed in some cases, but that functionality should be extended to the entire platform.

6. ## Recognition rather than recall
   
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. The menus and flows are simple and straight-forward enough to recognize the pattern. Additionally, most of the actions are visible or if in a menu, there is a hint to it.

7. ## Flexibility and efficiency of use
   
    Severity: 2
    
    Problems: A concern related to efficiency of use is the listing approach of the various entities. Scrolling and filtering gain unnecessary difficulty. FIltering is also not present. That feature should be added and, if necessary, minor fixes over the entities lists should be performed.

8.  ## Aesthetic and minimalist design
   
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. The portal has a minimal design, not to chaotic and clean enough so that the important information is assimilated by the user.

9. ## Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
    
    Severity: 0
    
    Problems: None. When a error occurs, the message is not the error code, but the message resuming the problem.

10. ## Help and documentation
    
    Severity: 1
    
    Problems: Although the tabs and fields are pretty specific and written in a way to be self explaining, sometimes additional information, possibly through a tooltip-like element would be recommended.
